			<p>This is the online version of the popular card-board game Sequence! Play with a friend and see who can make a sequence first.</p>
			<p>How to Play:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enter a username</li>
				<li>You need exactly 2 people to play this game, so you may need to wait for another user to connect in order to start the game.</li>
				<li>Once 2 players have connected, you will see a 10 x 10 Board of cards and 7 cards at the bottom.<br>
					The 10 x 10 Board is the same for both players. There are 2 occurences of each card on the board.<br>
					The 7 cards at the bottom are the cards in your hand. They differ for each player and will get updated after each turn. These cards are drawn from a shuffled deck of 104 cards (2 standard card decks).</li>
				<li>You will be assigned as either the Blue player or Green player.<br>
					Take turns clicking on cards on the Board to place tokens of your color on the Board.<br>
					You can only click on spaces that have cards that are in your hand (unless you have a Two-Eyed Jack).<br>
					Once you have placed a token on the board, that corresponding card from your hand will be discarded and replaced with a new card drawn from the shuffled deck. <br>
					You cannot click on a space that already has a token in it (unless you have a One-Eyed Jack).
					Use the "View All Possible Moves" button on the left to spot all the spaces you can select.</li>
				<li>The 4 corners are "Free Spaces".<br>
					You cannot place a token on a "Free Space".<br>
					Both players can use the "Free Space" to his/her advantage. </li>
				<li>There are 2 Special Wild Cards:
					<ul>
					<li><b>Two-Eyed Jack</b> (Jack of Clubs and Jack of Diamonds) : Represent any card. May be used to place a token on any space on the board. Use them to complete a sequence of block your opponent.
					</li>
					<li><b>One-Eyed Jack</b> (Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts) : Can remove an opponent's token from the board. However, you cannot remove a token that is part of a completed sequence.
					</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A sequence is any connection of 5 tokens in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).<br>
					The first player to form a sequence of his/her color wins! </li>
			</ul>
